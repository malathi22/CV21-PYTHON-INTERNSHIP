ADDITION OF TWO NUMBERS:

num1 = 1.5
num2 = 6.3
sum = num1 + num2
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))


TO FIND SQUARE ROOT:

num = 8 
num_sqrt = num ** 0.5
print('The square root of %0.3f is %0.3f'%(num ,num_sqrt))


TO FIND AREA OF TRIANGLE:

a = 5
b = 6
c = 7
s = (a + b + c) / 2
area = (s*(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) ** 0.5
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)
